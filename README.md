# Social Media User Submissions Frontend

## Description

This project is a React-based frontend for a user submission system where users can submit their name, social media handle, and upload multiple images. The submitted data is displayed on an Admin Dashboard, where admins can view the uploaded images and user details. The frontend communicates with a backend API to manage the submissions and dynamically updates the dashboard with the latest submissions every few seconds.
